<h2 class="section-title">me</h2>

<p>I ended the summer of 2017 with $120,000 in profit playing daily fantasy sports.  I had some good profits from my Ethereum and Bitcoin investments.   For nearly 10 years I had earned my living playing Poker and Daily Fantasy Sports online.  Though I had my best season ever that summer, the reality was making money gambling was getting harder and harder year by year. I knew that season would be one of my last.</p>

<p>The ability to study my interests without stress or responsibility what I'm most thankful for.  I studied statistics, physics, mathematics, finance, investing, game theory, history, cryptocurrency, art, and anything else that interested me.  Despite being a physics dropout, watching free university lectures on youtube is among my favorite activities to do in my free time.  I never studied anything because I had to, or because I had a career goal.  Everything I studied was because it interested me at the time, and I am so lucky to have had the opportunity to do that.</p>

<p>But my most important interest came at the end of that summer in 2017.  Increasingly I started turning to technology to give me an extra edge.  It started with using Microsoft Excel along with some statistical modeling.  During that summer of 2017 I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHO5NIcZAc4&list=PLNIs-AWhQzckr8Dgmgb3akx_gFMnpxTN5" target="_blank"><span>learned VBA for excel</span></a> to automate my processes and <a href="https://github.com/roninjin10/NBA-Stats-VBA" target="_blank"><span>scrape data</span></a>.  I found programming to be pretty interesting as I got better at it, so naturally I kept studying it.</p>

<p>My interest in computers and programming went much further than I could have anticipated.  I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb" target="_blank"><span>binged</span></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA" target="_blank"><span>hours</span></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rub-JsjMhWY&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSX7fVd4OUFp_ODd86H0ZIY" target="_blank"><span>of</span></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ" target="_blank"><span>of</span></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjZBTDzGeGg&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63gFHB6xb-kVBiQHYe_4hSi" target="_blank"><span>YouTube</span></a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKPlPJyQrt4" target="_blank"><span>videos</span></a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5gHiBUAIiU&list=UUbF-4yQQAWw-UnuCd2Azfzg" target="_blank"><span>about</span></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y62zj9ozPOM&list=PLhQjrBD2T3828ZVcVzEIhsHVgjANGZveu" target="_blank"><span>computer</span></a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo" target="_blank"><span>science</span></a>.  By winter I was <a href="https://github.com/roninjin10/toy-problems" target="_blank"><span>playing code golf</span></a> for fun nearly everyday, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/" target="_blank"><span>learning machine learning</span>, dabbling in web development, and considering turning my obsession into a career.</p>

<p>I feel extremely lucky to have stumbled upon something I am so interested in.  I enjoyed tons of subjects I have studied over the years but none of them turned into an obsession like programming did.  As soon as I wake up everyday I want to start programming or learning more about programming.  On March 5th 2018 I start a <span><a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/" target="_blank">coding bootcamp</a></span> to hopefully kick off a career as a software developer.</p>
